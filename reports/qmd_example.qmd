## Aim

This project explores the historical population of horses in Canada  
between 1906 and 1972 for each province.

## Data

Horse population data were sourced from the  
[Government of Canada's Open Data website](http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data)  
(Government of Canada, 2017a and Government of Canada, 2017b).

## Methods

The Python programming language (Van Rossum and Drake 2009)  
and the following Python packages were used to perform the analysis:  
pandas [@McKinney2010], altair [@VanderPlas2018], click (Team 2020),  
as well as Quarto [@Allaire2022].

## Results

![Horse populations for all provinces in Canada from 1906 - 1972](../results/horse_pops_plot.png){#fig-horse-pops}

We can see from Figure @fig-horse-pops that Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta  
have had the highest horse populations in Canada.  
All provinces have had a decline in horse populations since 1940.  
This is likely due to the rebound of the Canadian automotive industry  
after the Great Depression and the Second World War.  
An interesting follow-up visualisation would be car sales per year  
for each Province over the time period visualised above  
to further support this hypothesis.

Suppose we were interested in looking more closely at the province  
with the highest spread (in terms of standard deviation) of horse populations.  
We present the standard deviations in Table @tbl-horse-sd.

::: {.tbl #tbl-horse-sd}
**Table 1:** Standard deviation of historical (1906-1972) horse populations  
for each Canadian province.
:::

```{python, echo=false}
horses_sd_table = pd.read_csv("../results/horses_sd.csv")
largest_sd = horses_sd_table['Province'].values[0]
Markdown(horses_sd_table.to_markdown(index=False))
```

Note that we define standard deviation (of a sample) as:

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}{N-1} }$$

Additionally, note that in **Table @tbl-horse-sd** we consider  
the sample standard deviation of the number of horses  
during the same time span as Figure @fig-horse-pops.

![Horse populations for the province with the largest standard deviation](../results/horse_pops_plot_largest_sd.png){#fig-horse-largest width=65%}

Figure @fig-horse-largest shows the province with the largest standard deviation.

In Figure @fig-horse-largest, we zoom in and look at the province of `r largest_sd`,  
which had the largest spread of values in terms of standard deviation.
